# Xtime-_Webscraper
Web scraper design to collect data from xtime. 



This is a web scrape I created to get information from a workbook about upcoming and missed appointments. It was designed so it can go through the month to date and collect the customer information and reason for the appoint, so I can follow up and reschedule the appointment if it was needed or cancel if they could not make it. It was in an effort to retain my show ratio above 85%, which would give me a bonus. The script would be able to go through 100's of appointments and gather the needed info in about 5 min. (We averaged about 250+ appointments a day between Honda and Acura)

This script was developed while I was working at the number one Honda and Acura dealership in the nation and was only worked on while I was at work picking up an average of 200 calls a day.
